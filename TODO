- The program outputs a list of incorrectly spelled words. [x]
- For each misspelled word, the program outputs a list of suggested words. [x]
- The program includes the line and column number of the misspelled word.[x]
- The program prints the misspelled word along with some surrounding context. [x]
- The program handles proper nouns (person or place names, for example) correctly. [x]

- better input validation []
- handle punctuation  , . ; : ! ? [x]
- fix make file/build system [x]
- reorg code [x]
- writeup [x]

limitations:
-  handling of proper noun vs. first word in a sentence:

- contractions (unless explicitly specified)
- no transposition in edit distance
- distance of keys from eachother not considered in autocorrect
- have to read input text by line to make cursor position computable
- building BK-tree is slow
- one byte characters


- we are iterating the file twice, could do one pass and init both structures
- we could cache results for commonly seen misspellings
